## &to9

This is my strategy to trade eurgbp .

Rules :
open the 1- hour chart.

from the 6th hourly candle from the start of the day, till the 9th candle , mark out the high and the low .

pending order buy should be +1 pips above the high
pending order sell should be -1 pips below the low.

stop loss will be :
1) if buy order triggers then the stop loss will be the low -5 pips.
2) if sell order triggers then the stop loss will be the high +5pips.

take profits will be of 1:1 risk reward. for e.g. if the stop loss is 20 pips then take profit will also be 20 pips.

remember to add spreads in your buy sell pending orders and in your take profits and stop loss.

## EA Morning Levels

Trading begins at 5 pm GMT — open the M15 (a fifteen-minute) chart of the currency pair EURGBP (or USDCHF) and set the horizontal lines through the levels that end in 00 and 50 (respectively 000 and 500 for a five-digit price quotes from brokers, such as Alpari), which are closer to the price (1 above and 1 below the current price).
If the price is fluctuating at a level of 50 or 00 (+ — 5-10 points), then the basis is precisely this level, as the level of prices above and below the level of prices and set the lines above and below prices do not need ( but this is not so often).
Once the levels are set, exposing pending orders at a distance of 25 points from the upper level and -25 points on the lower level.

Stop-loss — 50 points. For insurance, you can use trailing stops.
Take-profit — 25 points.
Warrants, which were not open during the day — are removed and installed new ones.
